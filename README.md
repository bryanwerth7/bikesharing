# Bike Sharing Analysis
## Overview
In this analyis I looked at 2018 bike ride data in New York City from Citibike and created seveal different visualizations wih Tableau that analyzed a multitude of factors. I then created a Tableau story to show the results of these analysis to prove to hypothetical investors that a bike sharing system would work for Des Moines, just like it does for New York City.

## Results
The New York City Citibike data had a total of 2,344,224 users riding their bikes. Below is a plethora of graphs showing the trends in that data and how it could be used to inform decisions about the Des Moines potential investors:

- This line graph shows the amount of time users checked out bikes for their rides: most were around an hour bike trip:

 - This pie chart breaks down the users by gender, revealing that most of the users are male:

 - This line graph shows that all users, regardless of gender, still only check bikes out for about an hour for their rides:

 - This bar chart accumulates all riders in peak times in August and shows the time they checkout the bike. There is a peak around 8am-9am, and another from 5pm-8pm:

 - This heatmap shows the days of the week, informing that us that most rides are taken during the weekday during rush hour times. The Saturday checkout times are right around 12pm-1pm for the weekend days:

 - This heatmap is the same as before, but broken down into different genders tendencies:

 - This heatmap indicates that most bike users are subscribers to the Citibike platform, as opposed to just unsubscribed customers:

## Summary
We can conclude many things from our data analysis:
 - Most bike riders are male
 - Most rides are in the evening from 5pm-8pm, with a spike also around 8am-9am
 - Most of the riders are subscribed to the Citibike platform
 - Most trips only last around 1 hour

These are some great insights and will help our investors make decisions about whether a bike sharing system would work in Des Moines, but to further help the decision I would like to see a few more analyses. An analysis into age of riders would be helpful: are most of the riders younger, middle-aged, or older? Peak riding times suggest that most users are commuting to and home from work so age would be important to analyze as well. On the weekend if there are more social things to attend, younger populations might use bikes to get to and from concerts or events. Along with age, I would like to do another analysis into where the rides are taking place: maybe increasing the number of bike paths that are available will make more users check out a bike for a long weekend ride to get some good exercise in. Most of the riders in NYC are subscribers so if we could get a good base of subscribers, implementing an interactive app that users could use to challenge each other and compare length of rides or time trials would increase traffic on our bike sharing platform. Below I have linked my Tableau story that shows all of these graphs and allows you to interact with them, enjoy!
